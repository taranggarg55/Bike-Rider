# Bike-Rider
A metadata-analysis project based on python which collects data from various bike stations around VIT campus and display trends to help better allocation of bicycles.

# How does it work
Assume that there are various bike stations placed at various places in VIT campus. Whenever a student needs to use a bicycle he has to unlock it using his fingerprint. As soon as he unlocks a bike, computer registers and when he drops the bike at another stations, his details are stored into a database.

The data includes: Start Time, End Time, Trip Duration, Start Station, End Station, Gender and Year of Study

Bike Rider helps analysing this data by drawing graphs and showing trends based on each of these parameters. Various filters can be applied on the data based on month, day, campus(vellore, bhopal, chennai) etc.
